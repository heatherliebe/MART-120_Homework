Week 12. I had some help with week 11 code and I am finding it challenging to edit because it is too technical. I remade my game so it differs from week 11 a little bit. The HW said to use last weeks code, but I needed to remake it to understand it better. I am much happier with the end result and was able to edit for fun and creativity as desired! The only difference is, I didn't code the mouse click in the same way and it doesn't add an object with each click but adds an object where you click. 

 Use the AWDS keys to move the player. When you click the mouse an obstacle is added to the screen.
