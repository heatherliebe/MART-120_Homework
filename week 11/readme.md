This is my game that I made. Move across the line and you win. Use the AWDS keys to move the player. When you click the mouse obstacles are added to the screen.

I got help on the code for this game. I am having trouble editing it for week 12 homework. I want to redo this assignment and try making it with code that is more simple.
